- Use AWS S3 also in development??? The idea is to create the database locally and import it to heroku.
  Although if the images fail cause they are not in S3, I do not care so much ...
  Create a nice blog for me locally and import to heroku.

- Add locale switch in javascript ( current approach is ugly )

- email does not work in case user forgets password

- Currently only one user is allowed. More users with different privileges? extension?

- See more refinery plugin/engines from http://refinerycms.com/engines
